active_record_ws_support
========================

Usage:

- Client

      This adds some changes to ActiverRecord to make it work via web services with a new restful adapter. The ActiveRecord works as usual.
  
  Visit https://github.com/ramkidarla/active_record_ws_support/blob/master/client/README.md for more details.

- Server

      This will have a generic controller for handing web service calls and routes related to them.
